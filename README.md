## ATMOS: NFC-Assisted Attendance Monitoring

#### Description

The application developed in this repository is part of the final year project that I'm currently undertaking at the University of Portsmouth.

This web application serves as the front-end for serving the needs of the user.

#### Progress
The current progress of the project can be seen at [my blog](http://richardsolomou.com/blog/final-year-project/).

#### Abstract

> Determining student attendance in lectures is one of the most time-consuming processes at institutions around the UK. The computerisation of this process has been attempted many times both internally and in past literature, but has not managed to achieve the speed provided by its paper alternative as of yet. With the introduction of technologies such as RFID and NFC, door scanners have been installed in a large group of universities, granting access only to students with valid student cards.

> This project will develop an application for lecturers that will take advantage of the unique RFID chips in student cards,  using them to monitor student attendance in an effort to reduce the time taken to validate attendance at the beginning of lectures.
